# Employee Attrition Analysis – Salifort Motors
**Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate | Capstone Project**

## Overview
Data analytics and machine learning project focused on **understanding and predicting employee attrition** using HR data.  
The goal is to identify key drivers of turnover and provide **data-driven recommendations** for improving employee retention.

Implemented as part of a structured **PACE (Plan–Analyze–Construct–Execute)** workflow.

---

## Problem Statement
High employee turnover impacts productivity and cost.  
This project analyzes HR data to:
- Identify factors contributing to attrition
- Predict employees at risk of leaving
- Support HR decision-making with insights and models

---

## Dataset
HR dataset containing employee-level features such as:
- Satisfaction level, last evaluation
- Number of projects, average monthly hours
- Tenure, promotions, work accidents
- Department, salary level
- Attrition (target variable)

---

## Approach
**Plan & Analyze**
- Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates, outliers)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature understanding and correlation analysis

**Construct**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree (with feature engineering)
- Random Forest (baseline & improved models)

**Execute**
- Model comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Feature importance analysis
- Business-oriented insights and recommendations

---

## Key Insights
- Low satisfaction and excessive working hours strongly correlate with attrition
- Employees with long tenure and no promotions show higher churn risk
- Tree-based models outperform logistic regression for this problem
- Feature importance highlights workload and satisfaction as primary drivers

---

## Results
- Built and evaluated multiple classification models
- Improved performance through feature engineering
- Generated actionable HR recommendations based on model outputs

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **pandas, NumPy**
- **matplotlib, seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**


---

## Takeaways
This project demonstrates:
- End-to-end data analysis workflow
- Practical machine learning for business problems
- Ability to translate data insights into real-world recommendations
